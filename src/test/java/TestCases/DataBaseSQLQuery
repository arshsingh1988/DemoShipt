How would your define the relationships between each table?
Orders table has 1 to many relationship with Customers and Shoppers, as Orders table has Customer_id
and Shopper_id as well id columns.

Write a SQL query which would return the ID and store of an order tied to a specific Customer 
and shopper?

Select Orders.id, Orders.store
From Orders
JOIN Customers ON Orders.customer_id=Customer.id
JOIN Shoppers ON Orders.shopper_id=Shoppers.id
Where First_Name=''
And Last_name=''
group by Orders.id, Orders.store;
