1. If you choose to use a tool  or language other than recommended, briefly explain why?
I choose Selenium tools to automate UI and Java language to set up the test and object classes.
I have been using Java from last 3 years, so that is why I choose Java. But I am fine by Python and Ruby
and i believe I can pick up these language as all of them are object oriented languages.

2. How did you go  about  locating  the elements  for your  tests?
I usually use xpath to locate elements. In shipt.com i observed that most of the elements have specific 
text, so i used contains method to write Xpath.

3. What do you believe are the  most common  causes of instability  in UI automation?
I believe dynamic tags are the most common causes of instability in UI automation, and to over come the
instability I also look for unique tag names and attributes locate elements.

4. How do you make your  tests Consistent and  easy to debug?
For Consistent tests, I will first make use that I am using static elements to locate elements.
I will use comments to make methods more readable so that if someone else is looking into my scripts
they are easily read my test scripts and test methods.
Proper framework needed to make test scripts maintainable. I use PAge object methods to set up test framework .
