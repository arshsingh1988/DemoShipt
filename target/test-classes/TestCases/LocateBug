Description: Navigate to www.shipt.com and click on Help button and make sure Content is available when
user click on "What is Shipt" link.

Test Steps:
1. Navigate to www.shipt.com
2. Click on Help link located on top left hand side.
3. Click on "How Shipt Works"
4. Click on "+" icon to expand "What is Shipt"

Actual Result: When user click on "+" icon noting happens. Link is only expandable when user click on 
"What is Shipt?" text.

This seems like a cosmetic bug and does not effect the usability of the application, but it would be nice to
have a fix in place, so that user than expand the link by clink on "+" icon also.
  
  Priority of the Bug: 4 : Even it does not effect the workflow of the application but it would be nice to have
  a feature where user can expand the link via clicking on "+" icon.
